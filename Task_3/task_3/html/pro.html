<LI> Predicting the outcome of an Election Using data of Social Media: You need to collect data from social media and use NLP to understand the opinions of public through which you can predict the outcome of election result to some extent. You can also use previously used dataset in some of the earlier research and apply your own algorithms for the same.
<LI> Bot Detection in Social Media Accounts: In social media (Facebook, twitter, Instagram) there are multiple bot accounts used by various political parties or organisation for there benefits. Can you develop an algorithm to detect the bot accounts using some of the properties/features of bot accounts? It will help to us to use the data from real accounts in multiple analysis.
<LI>Storage and Analysis of Big data on Hadoop Cluster: One of the challenges associated with Big Data is how to efficiently store the enormous volume of data the other one how do we process the data in a distributed environment so as to obtain required knowledge. 
This project is intended to have exposure to above using Hadoop, Apache Spark, HBase etc
<LI>Image Classification using shift features: Shift features are scale invariant feature transform to find the local image features. In this project we find the shift features of an image and use them for classification.
<LI> Cloud-IoT Based Smart Camera. 
<LI>Cloud based IoT Home with Hindi Voice Commands using Google Assistant & ESP32.
<LI> Cloud based Temperature logging system.
<LI>  Develop and deploy a website using cloud foundry tool, supported by a Cloud vendor (ex. IBM Cloud)
<LI> Extract VM related information like number of processes running with their PID and name, address, CPU utilization, number of threads running etc. from hypervisor using LibVMI tool in Xen based virtualization environment.
<LI> Develop Cloud based Student Information Chatbot system.
<LI>   Cloud based Traffic Light Information System.
<LI> Cloud based Plant Communicator .
<LI>  Cloud based Smart Compost SysteM.
